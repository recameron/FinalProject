	<h2> about the game</h2>
      <p>Super Bowl LI was an American football game played at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, on February 5, 2017,[8][9] to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2016 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Atlanta Falcons, 34–28. Super Bowl LI featured the largest comeback in Super Bowl history,[10][11] with the Patriots overcoming a 28–3 deficit to emerge victorious. Due to the comeback, the Falcons' blown 28–3 lead would enter NFL lore.[12] The game was also the first Super Bowl to be decided in overtime.[13][14]

The Patriots' victory was their fifth, moving them into a three-way tie with the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers for the second most Super Bowl wins. After finishing the regular season with a league-best 14–2 record, New England advanced to their record-setting ninth Super Bowl appearance, their second in three years, and their seventh under the leadership of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. The Falcons, led by the league's top offense and MVP quarterback Matt Ryan, completed an 11–5 regular season record and were seeking their first Super Bowl title in their second appearance.

Atlanta led the first half 21–3 through scoring three unanswered touchdowns, which increased to 28–3 midway through the third quarter. However, the Patriots scored 25 unanswered points to tie the game in the final seconds of regulation. In overtime, New England received the kickoff after winning the coin toss and scored a touchdown to claim the franchise's fifth Super Bowl title. More than 30 team and individual Super Bowl records were broken or matched,[15] including Patriots running back James White's 14 receptions and 20 points scored[16] and Brady's 43 completed passes, 62 pass attempts, and 466 passing yards. Brady was named Super Bowl MVP for a record fourth time and was the oldest player to receive the honor at 39.

Fox's broadcast of the game averaged around 111.3 million viewers, slightly down from the 111.9 million viewers of the previous year's Super Bowl, while the total number of viewers for all or part of the game hit a record number of 172 million.[17][18] Average television viewership for the halftime show, headlined by Lady Gaga,[19] was higher at 117.5 million.[20] The game is regarded by many media outlets as the greatest Super Bowl of all time.[21][22][23].</p>
